  ``zope.interface.implementer`` decorator.

3.8.0 (2010-09-14)
------------------

- Added a test that makes sure that dublin core meta data of folder contents
  get updated when the folder gets copied. (Requires `zope.dublincore` 3.8
  or above.)


3.7.0 (2010-09-14)
------------------

- Honor the name given by the ``IObjectMover`` in
  ``OrderedContainerItemRenamer.renameItem``. It now returns the new of the
  obejct, too. Thanks to Marius Gedminas for the patch, and to Justin Ryan
  for the test.  Fixes
  https://bugs.launchpad.net/zope.copypastemove/+bug/98385.

  name which is the same as the current name.
  Fixes https://bugs.launchpad.net/zope.copypastemove/+bug/123532

- Remove use of ``zope.testing.doctestunit`` in favor of stdlib's ``doctest``.

- Moved ``zope.copypastemove``-related tests from ``zope.container`` here.

3.6.0 (2009-12-16)
------------------

- Favor ``zope.principalannotation`` over its ``zope.app`` variant.

- Avoid ``zope.app.component`` and testing dependencies.

3.5.2 (2009-08-15)
------------------

- Fix documentation for the ``IObjectCopier.copyTo`` method.

- Add a missing dependency on ``zope.app.component``.

3.5.1 (2009-02-09)
------------------

- Use the new ``zope.copy`` package for ObjectCopier to provide pluggable
  copying mechanism that is not dependent on ``zope.location`` hardly.

- Move the ``ItemNotFoundError`` exception to the interfaces module as
  it's part of public API.  Old import still works as we actually
  use it where it was previously defined, however, the new import
  place is preferred.

3.5.0 (2009-01-31)
------------------

- Use ``zope.container`` instead of ``zope.app.container``.

3.4.1 (2009-01-26)

------------------

- No further changes since 3.4.0a1.

3.4.0a1 (2007-04-22)
--------------------

- Initial release as a separate project, corresponds to
  ``zope.copypastemove`` from Zope 3.4.0a1
