3.6.0 (2009-12-16)
------------------

- Use zope.principalannotation in favor of its app variant.

- Avoid zope.app.component and testing dependencies.

3.5.2 (2009-08-15)
------------------

- Fix documentation for the IObjectCopier.copyTo method.

- Added missing dependency on zope.app.component.

3.5.1 (2009-02-09)
------------------

- Use the new zope.copy package for ObjectCopier to provide pluggable
  copying mechanism that is not dependent on zope.location hardly.

- Move the ItemNotFoundError exception to the interfaces module as
  it's part of public API. Old import still works as we actually
  use it where it was previously defined, however, the new import
  place is preferred.
